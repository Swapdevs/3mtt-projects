# Error Handling in Shell Scripting (Mini Project)
Error handling in shell scripting improves script reliability by anticipating issues such as invalid input, failed commands, or unavailable resources. Key steps include:

* Identifying potential errors (e.g., bad input, failed file operations)

* Using conditional statements to check command exit statuses

* Providing informative error messages to guide users

## S3 Bucket Error Handling Example
A common issue in scripts that create AWS S3 buckets is attempting to create a bucket that already exists. This is resolved by:

- Checking if the bucket exists with aws s3api head-bucket.

- Only creating the bucket if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

- Displaying clear messages for both success and failure cases.

This approach prevents duplication and enhances script robustness.
